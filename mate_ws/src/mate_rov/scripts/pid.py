#PID controller
#Python for now, might be changed to C

#TODO: Receive sensor data from Arduino 
#TODO: Pass sensor data to PID
#TODO: Output motor data to different Pi

#NOTE: Sensor data and motor data communication can be done outside here, and all of it is communicated via ROS (might work out better having a standalone PID controller, as it can run faster).
